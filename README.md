# DataLoggers_Arduino
Arduino data logging units for field measurements and lab filtration experiments

These are the codes i used for my Arduino data loggers used for my MSc thesis research. 
One data logger was deployed in the field, and used to collect information from a wastewater treatment system year-round: ORP (mV), Pressure (mBar), and Temperature (C).

The other data logger was used in my lab-scale membrane filtration experiments. 
This one, not only gathered data throughout the experiment (pressure, and weight), but also activated an external pump (via relay) that would activate whenever certain parameters were met, to ensure the physical safety of the experiment.
